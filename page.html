          <p>The Biodiversity Information System for Europe (BISE) is a single entry point for data and information on biodiversity supporting the implementation of the EU strategy and the Aichi targets in Europe. Bringing together facts and figures on biodiversity and ecosystem services, it links to related policies, environmental data centres, assessments and research findings from various sources. It is being developed to strengthen the knowledge base in support of the implementation of the EU biodiversity strategy and the assessment of progress in achieving the 2020 targets.</p>
